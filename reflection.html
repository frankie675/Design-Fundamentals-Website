<p class="reflection-para">I have found this first assignment very enjoyable, It has been great to learn new skills and refresh on some of my existing knowledge.

  Before I began this course I worked as an apprentice for a media company and here I managed multiple Moodle sites for clients. During this time I learnt a lot of HTML and CSS as well as some SQL and Java. However, I was learning off my own back so I was primarily self taught, this meant I wasn’t always going down the best route to accomplish things and I used a lot of trial and error. For this reason I enjoyed learning how to use flex box and how to create a website from scratch. It has given me the opportunity to fill in gaps in my knowledge and create something without 3rd party themes and plugins which I would have usually used. 
  
  My biggest weakness of this assignment was using Adobe InDesign, I struggled using this because I am a big fan of Adobe Photoshop. Having used Photoshop for around 5 years it was hard for me to use a new program that has a lot of differences especially when I knew exactly how I could create the same results in photoshop. After Watching some tutorials and learning some more about the software I was able to see the benefits of the program and was more comfortable using it.</p>
