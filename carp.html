                     <p>I started this poster by sourcing some stock images that had similar tones, I needed one that I could use as the subject and another for the background. The background image I put into Photoshop and added a blur filter to give the poster some depth, this also helps to compliment the subject and text. I then used the pen tool and masking in Photoshop to remove the background of the subject balloon. To make the subject look cohesive with the rest of the poster I used levels and colour mixer to try and match the colours.</p>

                     <p>I then added both of these assets separately into InDesign. From here I used the text wrap tools that are available in indesign so that my text would mould around my subject, I wanted to do this so that the text and images would compliment each other and both play equally important roles in the poster. I think this worked well because the text on a poster will often be the highest layer and will be the most important part where as my poster I think the subject image plays an important role also.</p>
                      
                     <p> Finally I added the logos at the bottom, I found this difficult because all of the logos are different sizes and shapes, so it was tricky to give them equal space on the page.
